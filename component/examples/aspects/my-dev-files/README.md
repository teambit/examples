# An Aspect using DevFiles API

An example of an Aspect using the Dev Files Aspect API to define a glob pattern of dev files (these are component files that need to be treated as development files).

This Aspect is configured in the [workspace config (`workspace.jsonc`)](https://github.com/teambit/examples/blob/master/workspace.jsonc to apply its configurations on all components in the workspace.
