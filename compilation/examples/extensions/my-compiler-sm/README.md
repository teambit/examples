# A compiler implementation for Bit

Uses Babel's API to provide compilation in development (in the workspace) and during build (in capsules). This implementation handles source files, as well.

- A similar [compiler implementation](https://github.com/teambit/examples/tree/master/compilation/examples/extensions/my-react-no-sm) that does not handle source maps.
