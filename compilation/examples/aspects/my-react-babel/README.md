# An Env Extension that Uses a Cusotm Compiler

This Env extends Bit's out-of-the-box React Env. 
It replaces React's TypeScript compiler with [a custom compiler implementation](https://github.com/teambit/examples/tree/master/compilation/examples/extensions/my-compiler-no-sm) (both for compilation in the workspace, as well as during build).
